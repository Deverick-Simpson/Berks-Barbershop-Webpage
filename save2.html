										<p>Cory Berks, better known around Lincoln, Nebraska as Big Berks the Barber, has been cutting hair since he was 12 years old. Cory specializes in hair, art, designs, fades, crispy lines and tapers.
										   In high school, he would charge his friend five dollars for a haircut and after graduation he spent sixteen months pursuing his barbering license at The College of Hair Design.
										   After 5 years of working at Oasis Barber Shop, Cory’s brother Nate decided to follow in his footstep and also became a barber.  The Dynamic Duo decided to open up a shop together.  They named it “Berks Barber Shop” and it has been open since May of 2013.
										</p>
										<p>“It’s been very rewarding opening my own shop,” Cory said.  “I really enjoy it and seeing it progress.  Watching it grow from nothing has been such a blessing.  It’s probably been the best move I’ve ever made, opening my own shop with my brother.”</p>							
										<p>Big Berks has made a great name for himself and his family by providing the community with a modern Barbershop that is very friendly and inviting. This shop truly has something to offer everyone that walks thru the door.
											Berks Barber Shop is known for high quality haircuts and top notch services. Clients come from all over to sit in Cory's chair to get special designs cut into their hair.
											"Drawing and Barbering comes natural to me," Cory said, "so mixing the two for me is the perfect outlet for me to express my art."

								<p>Through a business proposition and even more brotherly persuasion, I'm the second brother that contributed to molding Berks Barber Shop into what it is today. I established a passion for cutting hair through watching veterans when I was younger and practicing my own craft on fellow classmates when in high school. I moved forward in barbering to College of Hair Design where I honed my craft to become the barber I am today. After collaborating my new style with my older brothers already established clientele Berks Barber Shop was born.
								I specialize in fades and freestyle designs.</p>
								<p> My favorite thing to accomplish day in and day out is a way of transformation through my clients hair and personal appearance. Taking a large amount of hair off or completely changing someone's appearance around to give them the haircut that they've always been searching for is what's important and fun to me. Making someone feel good on the inside after leaving Berks Barber Shop is what makes barbering and amazing trait for me. My attention to detail and customer appreciation keeps my clients returning with family and friends as well.</p>

										<p>My name is Saul Sanchez and I eat, sleep, and cut hair. I am 20 years old and Just moved to Lincoln, Ne. Men’s grooming began for me in Omaha during my senior year. I was on the verge of committing to a 4 year university. I was going through a pretty rough time when one day I woke up and my first thought was literally “I’m going to learn how to cut hair.” I haven’t looked back since. Cutting hair for me is a sense of freedom. The ability to maneuver and style your hair the exact way you want it is what I’m trying to help you achieve day in and day out. When I’m not behind the chair you can find me somewhere around cars, family or friends.
										</p>
										<p>Barbering is hands down the best thing that’s ever happened to me. The ability to make my clients feel their best about themselves after a service is one of the best feelings out there. Paying attention to detail and remaining consistent are two traits that I possess that allow me make my clients at ease every time they sit in my chair. Making a move from Omaha, Ne to Lincoln, Ne at Berks Barbershop will only allow me to further and grow my skills. </p>

												<p>When I moved to Nebraska, all I wanted to do was finish high school An work a 9 to 5 job. Throughout high school I met someone who had a love for doing hair. She pushed an motivated me to becoming a barber, so I signed up for barber school!</p>

												<p>During Barber college I learned different types of cutting techniques An more! After 14 months of college I now specialize is in cutting all hair types, Fades, Tapers, Shear work, an I have wonderful customer service!

								  		<p>I'm 23 years old and after graduating from Northstar high school in 2011 I tried my athletic skills in college at Iowa State University, Iowa Central Community College, and Texas A&M University-Kingsville. After not getting the enjoyment from the college athlete life I came home and decided to try out what I always wanted to do in life, which is to be a barber.</p>
											<p> My dad has been a barber for 20+ years and owns his own shop so my whole life I've been involved with barbering and the barbershop experience. As I sat in the shop day in and day out, I watched in amazement at how my dad could change the way someone looked at such a fast pace, and be his own boss. This sparked something in me and it wasn't until I was 21 that I decided to follow a similar path and go to school, fall in love with the art, and graduate from the College of Hair Design. I specialize in designs, fades, line ups and just about anything else that involves clippers, shears, or razors. </p>

                            <p>"I have been a client of Mr.Berks for 6 years. It may seem hard to believe but
                             I remember my first haircut from Cory. It was April 17th 2009. It was a Friday.
                             I remember because it was an important day for me.
                             I was receiving an award from my job at the time.
                             As I was waiting in line for my cut, I noticed this new barber doing a design on a guy.
                             I observed many things that impressed me. His composure, concentration, and professionalism.
                             He wasn't loud, he didn't stop cutting to tell a story, and the end product had more detail and expression than any other I had seen bed.
                             I'm not knocking any other barbers but I saw something I felt was better than the rest.
                              That day I only got a design from him, which everyone at the conference kept asking where I got my haircut.
                              Mom has told me many times that "Clothes don't make the man, they make the man look better. Although a haircut makes a man feel better.
                              I have personal witnessed many transformations under his blade. No matter color, which there are many, I've seen guys sit down in his chair and transform into Men as they stand up."</p>

                            relaxed atmosphere, and I really like all the barbers.  They are just cool guys.  It's one of Lincoln's secrets but I think the word is pretty much out now."</p>
